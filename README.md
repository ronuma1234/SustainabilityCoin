# SustainabilityCoin: Rewarding Sustainable Activities

 Abstract

This project aims to investigate methods to address sustainability issues by using cryptocurrency technologies. By exploring the technologies, behind cryptocurrencies like blockchain, smart contracts and consensus mechanisms the project aims to utilize these tools to establish a sustainable and environmentally conscious society. The main focus is on how these technologies can be combined to incentivize and encourage behaviours in individuals and communities. The research will examine how cryptocurrencies can enable transparent and efficient transactions that align with sustainable activities and later build a prototype that showcases this.

The practical application of this research is seen in the creation of the SustainabilityCoin project, which is designed to reward users for participating in sustainable activities that relate to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Through this, the cryptocurrency aims to provide an incentive for individuals to adopt practices that promote practices that positively support the planet. Research will be done to find the optimal platforms that ensure that all transactions are secure and visible, thus enhancing user trust. The ultimate aim is to show that cryptocurrency can serve as a tool for encouraging and maintaining sustainability practices globally and innovatively, to solve some of todayâ€™s most critical challenges.
